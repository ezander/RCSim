/**
 * Interface for the mathematical description of rollercoaster tracks.
 * 
 * Implementations of this interface can use real physical models, maybe loaded 
 * from filed, or just describe parametric curves like circles.
 * 
 * Implementations must be described with respect to some curve parameter s. 
 * Closed curves must return the periodicity in getPeriod. The choice of curve 
 * parameter is up to the implementation: e.g. a circle could be implemented 
 * with a curve parameter repeating after s=1, or after s=2*pi, or after s=360. 
 * Of course, dependent functions (getx, getDxDx,...) must be modified 
 * accordingly.
